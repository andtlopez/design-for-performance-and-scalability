"Since the budget has been reduced to a maximum $6500, we've decided to do the changes below to reduced the cost of our infrastructure",,,,,,,
"1. The pricing model of both web and application servers to EC2 Instance Savings Plan - 1 year reservation term from on-demand. This plan reduced the cost by reserving instances in advanced, without drastically lowering the number of servers which is needed to maintain the performance of our application.",,,,,,,
"2.  In relation to item 1, we had to reduce the number of web servers from 16 to 14, and the number of application servers from 20 to 18 which should be enough to maintain performance and stability of our web application.",,,,,,,
3.We had to reduce S3 Standard and S3 Standard IA storage from 20 TB per month to 10 TB per month respectively. In no way will this affect performance but we'll have to watch out th file size of our web assets.,,,,,,,
"4. Finally, we reduced Route 53 basic checks from 100 to 50 and the number of elastic network interfaces from 10 to 5. This is not a drastic change but we might experience a bit of a performance drop if there's a spike in the number of users.",,,,,,,
